# GPUVM-IntelMPI-Cluster
This repository is intended to help Azure users to build NC24rs_v3 cluster, where two or more nodes will be participating. 

## Getting Started
This repository will be comprised of three parts.

* [Building NC24rs_v3 machines](https://github.com/AzureLGPod/GPUVM-IntelMPI-Cluster/tree/master/VMConfigurations)
* [Docker images for the virtual machines](https://github.com/AzureLGPod/GPUVM-IntelMPI-Cluster/tree/master/Dockerfolder_cuda9.0)
* [Samples to run](https://github.com/AzureLGPod/GPUVM-IntelMPI-Cluster/tree/master/horovod-sample)

There will be more docker images posted in near future.
